<center>COMPANY OVERVIEW
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=black><p align=center-left>The J’J Ala Sauce Sardin’s Ball is a small food place to be established by the owner of the product Jayr Calixtro according
to the owner, this company name was inspired by a popular or inexpensive store-bought dish called "Sardines." The proprietor
had an idea for the menu. My goal is to assist all consumers, especially those with a shelflife, in making safe and prudent food
choices. Foods should only be regarded safe to eat if they have been purchased in whole and are not damaged. Consumers should
always observe the manufacturer's storage recommendations, particularly regarding temperature and use of the product once it
has been opened. Consumers should also consider shelf-life information while purchasing goods in order to avoid wasting food.
The innovation and commoditization of new food products, processes, and services is known as food innovation. It's happening
now at a faster rate. Companies in the food and beverage industry are seeking for ways to create healthy, nutritious products that
are not only appealing, accessible, interesting, and unique, but also sustainable. The company will be founded at Brgy. Sto Cristo,
City of San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan, as a sole proprietorship. This location is a good source of revenue because many people
will be entertained by its original flavor and, most importantly, they will save even more money thanks to the low-cost products
we sell. This owner is concerned about how food affects the environment. One of the most difficult tasks we face is ensuring
that everyone in the country has sustainable access to a nutritious meal. We are responsible for expanding our market to
demographics and developing our own feature items because the company is constituted as a sole proprietorship. And Our
company's goal is to franchise it. We're focusing on franchising because it helps us avoid losing money.
